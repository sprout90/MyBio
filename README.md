# MyBio

## What is it?
A profile page that offers a brief insight into my background, interests, and fun facts. 

## Why?
The focus of this assignment was to demonstrate profiency in various HTML and CSS techniques.  Some applications of the techniques may seem random.  But, the purpose was to demonstrate a variety of HTML and CSS practices.  However, I may need another boot camp that focuses on design best practice.  ðŸ™‚

## Bonus
For my own interest, I also ensured that the page implemented responsive web design. This prevents the page from breaking when viewed on small form factor displays.
